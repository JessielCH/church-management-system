# General Architecture

The **Church Management System (Plan IEBB)** is designed as a Full-Stack Monorepo. This approach minimizes DevOps overhead and keeps both the frontend and backend tightly coupled and easy to maintain.

## C4 Context Diagram

Below is the high-level C4 Context Diagram illustrating how users interact with the system and how the system interacts with external services.
